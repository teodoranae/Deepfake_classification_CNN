# Deepfake classification using a CNN

### My solution for the Machine Learning class Kaggle competition

The task was to classify deepfake images into one of five classes, each corresponding to a different generative model. This is my CNN-based approach, which achieved 92.32% accuracy on the test set â€” the best result among my submissions.
